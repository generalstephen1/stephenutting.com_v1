						<h3 class='subHeader'>Process</h3>
				
				
				
						<ol>
				
				
				
						<li><strong>Research</strong><p>Of course the first place to start is research into what came before. Looking at famous Chaise designers such as Le Corbusier, The history of the item, how they're intended to be used as well as how they're actually used.</p></li>
				
				
				
						<li><strong>The drawing board</strong><p>Next came the sketchbook (at least for me) there were pages and pages of ideas both emotive and technical. These went through a screening process both of what I wanted to do as well as various outside opinions as to what looked and felt the best. </p></li>
				
				
				
						<li><strong>Mock ups</strong><p>A similar process as above except with physical mock-ups, normally made of card and wire, though in this case there were a few paper mache and clay elements to some of the more biological ideas. Once again hundreds of concepts went through a screening process of what I liked, what my peers liked and this time what various members of staff thought were good ideas. It was also where outside experts such as engineers were first asked as to the possibility of these things existing at full size. These ideas were put into more high quality workshop-built mock-ups made of primitive workshop materials. </p></li>
				
				
				
						<li><strong>Digitisation</strong><p>The model seen in the photos was constructed off digital specifications. Using 3D autoCAD software Solidworks I built each part and assembled them to create renders which are easier to manipulate for small changes, it was at this point that a slight dip was put in the design in which to sit upon. It was also where the aerial view was noticed in it's likeness to a birds wing which eventually led to the name Avian Chaise.</p></li>
				
				
				
						<li><strong>Build and Present</strong><p>The final assessment on this project was on a 1:16 scale model of the Chaise. To make this model as accurate as possible I used a lasercutter machine to get the wooden slats accurate to my digital model. Once again engineers were brought in to check the ideas validity, in the final design the intent was to have no glue whatsoever for ease in dismantling, this proved successful and so in a matter of minutes the 4.5m (4yd 2.7ft) can be dismantled into 42 slats ready to be flat-packed and transported (42 being the answer to everything).</p></li>

						<h3 class='subHeader'>Skills Gained or Used</h3>
				
				
				
						<p>Within this project I used more small skills than I can list here, the big three however were definitely centred around good time management, working to a brief and using good communication skills. These were utilised with each presentation and communication of ideas to a wide audience. As I wanted this Idea to be successful I also had to have items ready for outside specialists to view as well as be able to explain the concepts grounding the ideas.</p>
				
				
				
						<h3 class='subHeader'>Tools/Technical skills used</h3>
				
				
				
						<p>In the project I extensively used autoCAD software Solidworks and Adobe Photoshop. Adobe Illustrator was used to communicate with the Lasercutter and mockups made in the workshop required skills on multiple types of electrical saws and woodworking tools.</p>
